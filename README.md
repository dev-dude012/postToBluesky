# üñºÔ∏è Post Images to Bluesky with Python

This project shows how to post a local image to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) with a caption and clickable hashtags using the [atproto](https://atproto.blue/en/latest/) Python library.

## üöÄ Features
- Uploads an image from a local file
- Adds a caption
- Appends clickable hashtags
- Posts to Bluesky

## üì¶ Requirements
Make sure you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.
```bash
pip install atproto
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
- Make sure to update the 'username' and 'password' variables within the script to match your Bluesky credentials.
  - I recommend using an [App Password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords/), not your account password.
- Also update the 'file_path' variable to match the image you would like to upload.
  - Image must be under 975 kB and in the same folder as your python file.
